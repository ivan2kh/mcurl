# mcurl

`mcurl` is a libcurl/libev-based asynchronous transport (http, smtp)

## Todo
* Replace base64 with new one as submodule (and merge my changes if needed)
* Adapt the subj to support external event loop
* Tests
* Revise api, constness and so on
* Translate comments :)

### notice
Got it out as is. Used in production, tests have been lost.
